"""
This Interface is what people outside of datalayer will use to talk to us.
If this grows a lot we have the availability to split things up for how it makes sense but for now this one class will work.

This will hopfully will sortof be a library for people to use.
The reason it only has gets and reads is because i'm trying to avoid anyone having to think about data.
So if the data does not exist create it sort of thing.
